### 📋 Prerequisites

Before you run Proxy Share, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

This will start the proxy scraping process. The application will fetch public proxies and consolidate them into a usable format.

### 📈 Features

- **Automatic Scraping**: The application automatically scrapes multiple sources for public proxy nodes.
- **Consolidation**: It organizes the proxies into a single list for easy access.
- **Customizable**: You can modify the source URLs and other settings to suit your needs.

### 📄 Example Output
